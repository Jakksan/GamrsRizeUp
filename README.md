•	Statement of work:
  - Our forum is for all gamers to have a free place to voice their opinions, criticisms, and strategies for all games. We wanted to create a safe space for gamers to  release their stress and help each other out through tough times in games. We require all of our website visitors to create a user account in order to view and post forum posts. The reason why we need a database is so that we can store user credentials, forum posts, and media (pictures, gifs, videos, etc.) that users attach with their forum posts. 
  -	Our forum boards will have discussion boards, polls, and news.
  -	In our website, we will have two types of users: general and admin. General users will be able to create a post, reply to other posts, and delete their own posts. 
 
Admins will be able to do the same things that general users can do as well as delete anyone’s posts (if they violate rules), reset a user’s password, and ban users. 

	Note: The reason why we need the separate admin type of accounts is because we need the admins to moderate the discussions and help general users with any account issues.

•	Initial roles and tasks of each members:
  -	Pranay Kumar Marella- Frontend Developer
  -	Justin Paulk- Backend Developer
  -	Robert Ward- Database Developer/Administrator 
  -	Jackson De Gruiter- Frontend Developer
	Note: The reason why we have two frontend developers is because we feel like this will be one of the harder parts of the project.
